This was originally written for internal use by myself and a few collaborators, so pardon the organization or lack thereof. The phrase "coligos" refers to very short oligos added to each well as a cross-contamination check. See Harrison et al. 2021 (Characterizing microbiomes... mSystems) for more on coligos: https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mSystems.00294-21
